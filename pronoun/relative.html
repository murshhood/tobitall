            <h3>Relative Pronoun</h3>
            <p>
                Relative pronouns introduce the relative clause. They are used to make clear what is being talked about in a sentence. They describe something more about the subject or the object.
            </p>
            <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The car that was stolen was the one they loved most.</li>
                <li>A person who loves nature is a good person.</li>
                <li>Our school, which was founded in 1995, is being renovated.</li>
                <li>I will accept whichever party dress you buy me on Valentine's Day.</li>
                <li>Whoever you are behind this great initiative, I want to thank you.</li>
            </ol>

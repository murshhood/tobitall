            <h3>Possessive Pronoun</h3>
            <p>
                Possessive pronouns replace the nouns of the possessive adjectives: my, our, your, her, his, their. The possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, hers, his, its, theirs. The pronoun ‘who’ also has a possessive form, whose.
            </p>    
            <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I thought my bag was lost, but the one Kesrick found was mine. (Here, ‘mine’ refers to ‘my bag’)</li>
                <li>Their vacation will start next week. Ours is tomorrow. (Here, ‘ours’ refers to ‘our vacation’)</li>
                <li>Those four suitcases are ours.</li>
                <li>Is this yours?</li>
                <li>You have to take either her car or theirs. Hers is better than theirs. (Here, ‘her’ is possessive adjective and ‘hers’ and ‘theirs’ are possessive pronouns which replaced ‘her car’ and ‘their car’)</li>
            </ol>
